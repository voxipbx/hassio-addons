## Add-ons provided by this repository

### [folder-rsync]

This simple addon transfers the Hass.io folders /addons, /backup, /config, /share, /ssl and /media to a remote rsync server (e.g. a Synology NAS).
The addon transfers the changes to the destination at every start. After the transfer it stops.

You might want to start the transfer with a HASS automation
```
- id: '7'
  alias: Folder sync to NAS
  trigger:
    platform: time
    at: '1:00:00'
  action:
  - service: hassio.addon_start
    data:
      addon: 954f2f4e_folderrsync
```

### [remote-backup]

This addon is a fork of the great backup addon https://github.com/mr-bjerre/hassio-remote-backup of @mr-bjerre, which creates and manages snapshots and has a SCP function. It is enhanced so that it is also able to transfer the Hass.io folders /addons, /backup, /config, /share, /ssl and /media to a remote rsync server (e.g. a Synology NAS).
The addon transfers the changes to the destination at every start. After the transfer it stops.
